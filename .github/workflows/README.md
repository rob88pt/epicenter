# CI/CD Workflows

All workflows live flat in `.github/workflows/` (GitHub Actions requirement). We use **period-delimited prefixes** so they group naturally when sorted alphabetically. Periods are structural delimiters (category from name); hyphens are word separators within a segment.

## Naming Convention

| Prefix | Purpose | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `release.{app}` | Tag-triggered desktop builds + GitHub Release | Per Tauri app (expensive 4-platform matrix) |
| `pr-preview.{app}` | PR preview desktop builds | Per Tauri app (expensive 4-platform matrix) |
| `deploy.{target}` | Web app deployment | All web apps together (cheap, fast) |
| `ci.{name}` | Code quality checks | Whole repo |
| `auto.{name}` | Automated repo maintenance | Whole repo |
| `meta.{name}` | Repo housekeeping | Whole repo |

Tauri desktop apps get **separate per-app workflows** because builds run a 4-platform matrix (macOS ARM, macOS Intel, Ubuntu, Windows) taking 20+ minutes. A PR touching only Whispering shouldn't trigger an Epicenter build.

Web apps (Cloudflare Workers) deploy **together in one workflow** because deploys are fast (~2 min on a single runner) and share the same build step.

## Workflows

### Desktop Releases

| File | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `release.whispering.yml` | `v*` tags, manual | Builds Whispering for 4 platforms, publishes to GitHub Releases as draft. Includes code signing, notarization, and release notes from `docs/release-notes/`. |
| `pr-preview.whispering.yml` | Pull requests | Builds Whispering for 4 platforms, uploads as PR artifacts. Cancels previous builds via concurrency groups. |

### Web Deployment (Cloudflare Workers)

| File | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `deploy.cloudflare.yml` | Push to `main`, manual | Validates (typecheck, lint, build), then deploys Whispering + Landing to Cloudflare Workers in parallel. Posts Discord notification. |
| `deploy.cloudflare-preview.yml` | Pull requests touching `apps/whispering/**`, `apps/landing/**`, `packages/**` | Uploads preview versions via `wrangler versions upload --preview-alias`. Posts PR comment with preview URLs. No cleanup needed (aliases auto-expire at 1000). |

### CI

| File | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.format.yml` | Push, pull requests | Runs `bun run lint:check` and `bun run typecheck`. |
| `ci.autofix.yml` | Push, pull requests | Runs `bun run format` and commits fixes back via autofix-ci. |

### Automation

| File | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `auto.label-issues.yml` | Issues opened/edited | Uses Claude to auto-label issues by type, priority, platform, and area. |
| `auto.release.yml` | PR merged to `main` | Bumps version, collects `## Changelog` entries from merged PRs, commits release, tags, creates GitHub Release with grouped changelog. |

### Meta

| File | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `meta.sponsors-readme.yml` | Daily schedule, manual | Updates README sponsors section. |
| `meta.sync-releases.yml` | Release published/edited, manual | Mirrors releases from EpicenterHQ/epicenter to braden-w/whispering (downstream). |
| `meta.update-readme-version.yml` | Release published, manual | Updates download link versions in Whispering README via sed. |

### Uncategorized

| File | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `claude.yml` | `@claude` mentions in issues/PRs | Runs Claude Code agent to respond. One-off, no prefix needed. |

## Rollback

**Web apps**: Revert the commit on `main` and push, or for immediate rollback: `bunx wrangler rollback --name <worker-name>`.

**Desktop releases**: Delete the draft release and re-tag from an earlier commit.
