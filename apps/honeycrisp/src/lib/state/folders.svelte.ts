/**
 * Reactive folder state for Honeycrisp.
 *
 * Manages folder CRUD operations and the reactive folder list. Backed by
 * a Y.Doc CRDT table, so folders sync across devices. Uses a factory
 * function pattern to encapsulate `$state`.
 *
 * Observers are registered once during factory construction and never
 * cleaned up (SPA lifetime).
 *
 * @example
 * ```svelte
 * <script>
 *   import { foldersState } from '$lib/state';
 * </script>
 *
 * {#each foldersState.folders as folder (folder.id)}
 *   <p>{folder.name}</p>
 * {/each}
 * <button onclick={() => foldersState.createFolder()}>New Folder</button>
 * ```
